0. Create a script to format the entries (replace the perl script with Python because I can't run Perl)
1. Number the entries
2. Create lists (sectorials) for base factions
3. Create mechanism to filter out options from base data for a particular list ie. Sectorial-only profiles
4. Shift the data entries from string links to id links. String names are fragile
5. Update the ISC/name values to current inputs (crowd help) (possibly after HSN3)
